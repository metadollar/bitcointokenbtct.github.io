The aims of the Bitcoin Token website are to make a very simple, graphically pleasing experience with minimal technical content aimed at beginners in crypto-currencies.

All technical data for the chain can be found here on github or on the BitcoinTalk thread. 

We are using the domain <a href="http://www.bitcointoken.pw/">bitcointoken.pw</a> to resolve the website though it is 100% hosted on github =-)
